<scenario_description>
This enhanced scenario takes place on a busy 4-lane highway during rush hour with moderate traffic density. The scenario features multiple challenging interactions including several lane changes, a sudden braking event, and a near-miss situation. The main challenge involves Vehicle 1 attempting to navigate through traffic while multiple vehicles perform lane changes around it. Vehicle 3 performs an aggressive cut-in maneuver in front of Vehicle 1, forcing it to brake suddenly. Meanwhile, Vehicle 6 (a new vehicle) enters from an on-ramp and needs to merge quickly, creating additional complexity. Vehicle 7 (another new vehicle) experiences a mechanical issue and slows down unexpectedly in the leftmost lane. This combination of events creates a challenging multi-agent interaction scenario that tests an autonomous vehicle's prediction, planning, and decision-making capabilities.

<enhancement_strategy>
I've enhanced the scenario by:
1. Adding two new vehicles (6 and 7) to increase traffic density and complexity
2. Creating a critical cut-in maneuver by Vehicle 3 in front of Vehicle 1
3. Introducing a sudden braking event that propagates through traffic
4. Adding a merging situation with Vehicle 6 entering from an on-ramp
5. Creating a vehicle with mechanical issues (Vehicle 7) that behaves unexpectedly
6. Coordinating multiple lane changes happening in close proximity
7. Designing near-miss situations that require precise trajectory planning
8. Creating scenarios where the optimal path is temporarily blocked
9. Ensuring vehicles maintain realistic physics and driving behaviors
10. Introducing varying speeds and acceleration/deceleration patterns
