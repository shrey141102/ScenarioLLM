[SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]
This scenario takes place on a 4-lane highway. The ego vehicle (Vehicle 10) is attempting to merge from an on-ramp (represented by lane 2) onto the main highway (lanes 3, 5, and 6). Traffic is moderately heavy. Vehicle 1 is traveling at a high speed in lane 5, approaching from behind. Vehicle 2 is traveling at a moderate speed in lane 3. Vehicle 3 is in lane 6, initially ahead of the ego vehicle but slowing down due to a phantom traffic jam ahead. Vehicle 4 is in lane 3, initially behind the ego vehicle, and accelerates to prevent the ego vehicle from merging. Vehicle 5 is in lane 5, performing a lane change to lane 6. Vehicle 6 is in lane 6, performing a lane change to lane 5. Vehicle 7 is in lane 3, slowing down. Vehicle 8 is in lane 5, maintaining speed. Vehicle 9 is in lane 6, accelerating. The ego vehicle must successfully merge onto the highway while avoiding collisions and maintaining a safe following distance. The speed limit is effectively ignored due to the traffic conditions.
[/SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]

[ENHANCEMENT_STRATEGY]
The scenario is made more challenging by:

1.  **Adding an on-ramp merge:** This forces the ego vehicle to make a critical decision and execute a complex maneuver.
2.  **Increasing traffic density:** More vehicles increase the likelihood of conflicts and require more careful planning.
3.  **Introducing lane changes:** Vehicles changing lanes create unpredictable situations and require the ego vehicle to anticipate their movements.
4.  **Adding a phantom traffic jam:** This forces vehicles to slow down unexpectedly, creating a dynamic and potentially dangerous situation.
5.  **Conflicting behaviors:** Vehicle 4 actively prevents the ego vehicle from merging, requiring a more assertive and strategic merging maneuver.
