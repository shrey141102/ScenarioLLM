<scenario_description>
This enhanced scenario takes place on a busy 4-lane highway with bidirectional traffic. The scenario features multiple vehicles executing complex maneuvers including lane changes, speed adjustments, and responses to a sudden slowdown caused by a vehicle experiencing mechanical issues. The main challenge centers around a vehicle that begins to decelerate unexpectedly in lane 3, causing a cascade of reactions from surrounding vehicles. Some vehicles attempt to change lanes to avoid the slowing vehicle, while others must brake suddenly. This creates a challenging environment with multiple simultaneous lane changes, varying speeds, and potential conflict points. The autonomous vehicle must navigate through this dynamic environment while maintaining safety and efficiency.

<enhancement_strategy>
I've enhanced the scenario by:
1. Creating a realistic traffic slowdown event (Vehicle 4 experiencing mechanical issues)
2. Introducing multiple simultaneous lane changes in response to this event
3. Adding vehicles with varying speeds and behaviors
4. Creating potential conflict points where vehicles may compete for the same space
5. Including both aggressive and defensive driving behaviors
6. Designing cascading reactions where one vehicle's behavior triggers responses from others
7. Maintaining physical realism with proper acceleration/deceleration rates
8. Ensuring lane changes follow realistic trajectories with appropriate heading changes
9. Creating situations requiring prediction and planning (vehicles signaling intention to change lanes)
10. Incorporating both cooperative and non-cooperative driver behaviors
