[SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]
In this enhanced scenario, the highway remains a 4-lane road with a speed limit of 100 km/h. The traffic density is increased, and the vehicles exhibit more complex interactions, including simultaneous lane changes and speed variations. The scenario introduces a construction zone in lane 3, requiring vehicles to merge into adjacent lanes. Additionally, a sudden weather change introduces heavy rain, reducing visibility and road friction, challenging the autonomous vehicles' perception and control systems. Vehicles must navigate these conditions while maintaining safe distances and speeds.

[/SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]

[ENHANCEMENT_STRATEGY]
To make the scenario more challenging, the following strategies are employed:
1. Increased Traffic Density: More vehicles are introduced, increasing the complexity of interactions.
2. Construction Zone: A section of lane 3 is closed, requiring vehicles to merge into lanes 2 or 4.
3. Weather Conditions: Heavy rain reduces visibility and road friction, testing the vehicles' adaptive capabilities.
4. Simultaneous Lane Changes: Multiple vehicles perform lane changes at the same time, increasing the risk of collisions.
5. Speed Variations: Vehicles adjust speeds dynamically in response to traffic and weather conditions, requiring precise control.
