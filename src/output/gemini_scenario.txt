[SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]
This scenario takes place on a busy four-lane highway with a speed limit of 100 km/h. The ego vehicle (Vehicle 10) is attempting to merge from an on-ramp (represented by lane 2) onto the main highway (lanes 3, 5, and 6). Traffic is heavy and moving at varying speeds. Vehicle 1 is approaching rapidly in lane 5, requiring the ego vehicle to carefully time its merge. Vehicle 2 is traveling at a slower speed in lane 3, potentially blocking the ego vehicle's path if it merges too late. Vehicle 3 is performing a lane change from lane 6 to lane 5, adding another layer of complexity. Vehicle 4 is aggressively tailgating Vehicle 2 in lane 3. Vehicle 5 is maintaining a constant speed in lane 6. Vehicle 6 is slowing down in lane 5 due to the lane change of Vehicle 3. Vehicle 7 is accelerating in lane 3. Vehicle 8 is performing a lane change from lane 3 to lane 2. Vehicle 9 is maintaining a constant speed in lane 6. The scenario challenges the ego vehicle to safely and efficiently merge onto the highway while navigating complex interactions and unpredictable behavior from surrounding vehicles. The on-ramp is short, limiting the time available for the merge.
[/SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]

[ENHANCEMENT_STRATEGY]
The original scenario is enhanced by increasing the density of traffic and introducing more complex interactions. Specifically, the addition of an on-ramp and the requirement for the ego vehicle to merge creates a challenging task. The varying speeds of vehicles, lane changes, and aggressive driving behaviors (tailgating) further complicate the scenario, demanding sophisticated decision-making from the autonomous vehicle. The short on-ramp adds temporal constraints, forcing the ego vehicle to react quickly and accurately.
