<scenario_description>
This enhanced scenario takes place on a busy 4-lane highway with bidirectional traffic. The scenario features a complex series of lane changes and near-miss situations that challenge an autonomous vehicle's prediction and planning capabilities. The scene involves multiple vehicles performing sequential lane changes, creating a "chain reaction" effect, with some aggressive drivers cutting in with minimal gaps. Additionally, there's a slower vehicle ahead forcing multiple cars to make evasive maneuvers. A motorcycle weaves through traffic at high speed, and a truck with limited visibility creates additional complexity. The scenario culminates with a vehicle suddenly braking due to debris on the road, forcing surrounding vehicles to react quickly.
</scenario_description>

<enhancement_strategy>
I've enhanced the scenario by:
1. Adding more vehicles with varying dynamics (including a motorcycle and truck)
2. Creating cascading lane changes where one vehicle's action triggers responses from others
3. Introducing more aggressive cut-ins with minimal safety gaps
4. Adding a sudden braking event due to road debris
5. Including a high-speed motorcycle weaving through traffic
6. Creating situations with partially occluded visibility
7. Maintaining realistic physics and vehicle capabilities while pushing the boundaries of challenging interactions
8. Designing multiple simultaneous interactions that require an autonomous system to track and predict multiple agents
9. Creating situations where the optimal path forward requires negotiation with other road users
