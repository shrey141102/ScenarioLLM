In this scenario, as a cautious driver, I would initially maintain my speed while assessing the situation. Upon noticing the vehicle ahead braking hard, I would begin to decelerate gradually to maintain a safe following distance. I would avoid making any sudden lane changes due to the complexity of the traffic situation and the presence of multiple vehicles changing lanes. My trajectory reflects a gradual reduction in speed to ensure safety and maintain control of the vehicle.
