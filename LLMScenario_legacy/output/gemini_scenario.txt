[SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]
This scenario depicts a challenging situation on a 4-lane highway with traffic moving in opposing directions. The Ego vehicle (Vehicle 1) is traveling at high speed in Lane 5 (one of the lanes for its direction). Ahead of the Ego vehicle in the same lane is Vehicle 3. In the adjacent right lane (Lane 6), two vehicles (Vehicle 11 and Vehicle 6) are present. Vehicle 11, initially ahead and to the right of the Ego, initiates an aggressive lane change into Lane 5, cutting relatively close in front of Vehicle 3. Almost simultaneously, Vehicle 6, slightly ahead and right of the Ego, also attempts to change into Lane 5 but aborts the maneuver due to Vehicle 11's action, swerving back into Lane 6. Immediately following Vehicle 11's cut-in, Vehicle 3 brakes sharply. This forces the Ego vehicle (Vehicle 1) to react quickly by braking and potentially considering an evasive maneuver. Concurrently, in the opposing traffic lanes, Vehicle 4 (Lane 3) executes a noticeable swerve within its lane as it passes the developing situation, adding an element of distraction and potential perceived risk from oncoming traffic. Vehicle 7 follows the Ego vehicle in Lane 5. Vehicles 2 and 5 proceed normally in the opposing direction in Lanes 2 and 3 respectively.

[ENHANCEMENT_STRATEGY]
The original scenario involved standard highway driving with typical lane changes. This enhanced version introduces multiple layers of complexity and challenge:
1.  **Aggressive Cut-in:** Vehicle 11 performs a cut-in maneuver into the Ego's lane (Lane 5), reducing the headway to the vehicle ahead (Vehicle 3).
2.  **Sudden Braking Event:** Vehicle 3 brakes sharply immediately after being cut off, creating a critical braking scenario for the following Ego vehicle (Vehicle 1).
3.  **Simultaneous Conflicting Maneuvers:** Vehicle 6 attempts a lane change into the same space Vehicle 11 is targeting, creating a conflict that requires one vehicle (Vehicle 6) to abort, adding complexity to predicting traffic behavior.
4.  **Ego Vehicle Perspective:** Vehicle 1 is explicitly the Ego vehicle, making the braking event and the surrounding maneuvers directly challenging for its decision-making logic.
5.  **Opposing Traffic Disturbance:** Vehicle 4's swerve in the opposing lane adds complexity by creating a potential, albeit indirect, hazard or distraction that the Ego's perception and planning system must account for.
6.  **Increased Density around Ego:** More vehicles are positioned strategically around the Ego to create a denser, more interactive environment compared to the sparse initial description.
