In this scenario, I initially maintain my speed of 20 m/s, but as the vehicle ahead suddenly brakes, I begin to decelerate to ensure safety. I reduce my speed to 15 m/s by 1.2 seconds and further to 10 m/s by 1.4 seconds, maintaining this speed to keep a safe distance while monitoring the traffic situation. My trajectory reflects a cautious approach, prioritizing safety and maintaining control of the vehicle.
