[SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]
This scenario takes place on a 4-lane highway. The ego vehicle (Vehicle 100) is attempting to merge from an on-ramp (represented by lane 7, which merges into lane 6) onto the highway. Vehicle 1 is traveling in lane 5 at a high speed. Vehicle 2 is traveling in lane 2 at a moderate speed. Vehicle 3 is traveling in lane 5, initially ahead of the ego vehicle, but slowing down. Vehicle 4 is traveling in lane 3 at a high speed. Vehicle 5 is traveling in lane 3 at a high speed, slightly ahead of Vehicle 4. Vehicle 31, initially in lane 5, makes an aggressive lane change into lane 6, cutting off the ego vehicle as it attempts to merge. Simultaneously, Vehicle 60, initially in lane 6, begins a lane change into lane 5, further complicating the situation. The ego vehicle must safely merge onto the highway while avoiding collisions with the other vehicles, reacting to the aggressive lane changes of Vehicle 31 and Vehicle 60, and managing its speed relative to Vehicle 1 and Vehicle 3. A disabled vehicle (Vehicle 99) is present on the shoulder (lane 7 after the on-ramp merges), adding a visual distraction and potential hazard.
[/SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]

[ENHANCEMENT_STRATEGY]
The scenario is made more challenging by:

1.  **Adding an ego vehicle (Vehicle 100) performing a merge maneuver:** Merging is a complex task requiring gap selection, speed matching, and awareness of surrounding vehicles.
2.  **Introducing aggressive lane changes (Vehicle 31 and Vehicle 60):** These sudden maneuvers force the ego vehicle to react quickly and adjust its trajectory.
3.  **Creating conflicting lane changes:** Vehicle 31 and Vehicle 60 are changing lanes in opposite directions, increasing the density of traffic and the likelihood of a collision.
4.  **Adding a disabled vehicle (Vehicle 99) on the shoulder:** This serves as a visual distraction and a potential hazard if the ego vehicle drifts too far to the right.
5.  **Modifying the speeds of existing vehicles:** Vehicles are given speeds that create tighter gaps and require more precise maneuvering from the ego vehicle.
6.  **Introducing an on-ramp (lane 7 merging into lane 6):** This adds complexity to the lane structure and requires the ego vehicle to navigate the merge point.
