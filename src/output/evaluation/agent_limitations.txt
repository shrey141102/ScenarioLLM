# Agent Implementation Limitations

The current agent implementation has the following limitations:

1. **Format Mismatch**: Agents generate philosophical descriptions instead of trajectory data
2. **Task Misinterpretation**: Agents focus on their role definition rather than the specific task
3. **Lack of Structure**: The output lacks the precise structure needed for scenario visualization
4. **Abstract vs. Concrete**: Agents provide abstract driving philosophy rather than concrete coordinates

## Potential Improvements

1. Modify the CrewAI task prompt to explicitly request trajectory data in the required format
2. Use more structured prompts with clearer formatting examples
3. Implement a post-processing step to convert agent outputs to valid trajectory formats
4. Consider a hybrid approach where LLMs generate trajectories and agents enhance them with behavioral nuances
