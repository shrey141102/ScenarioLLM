[SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]
In this enhanced scenario, the highway remains a 4-lane road with the same lane IDs: 5, 2, 3, and 6. The speed limit is corrected to 120 km/h. The scenario introduces a construction zone in lane 3, causing a bottleneck and requiring vehicles to merge into adjacent lanes. Additionally, a sudden rainstorm reduces visibility and road friction, challenging the vehicles' sensors and control systems. Vehicles must navigate through the construction zone while maintaining safe distances and adapting to the reduced traction. The scenario includes a mix of vehicles with varying speeds and aggressive lane changes, simulating real-world driving conditions under adverse weather.
[/SCENARIO_DESCRIPTION]

[ENHANCEMENT_STRATEGY]
To make the scenario more challenging, a construction zone is introduced in lane 3, requiring vehicles to merge into lanes 2 and 5. The sudden rainstorm adds complexity by reducing visibility and road friction, testing the vehicles' sensor capabilities and control algorithms. The interactions between vehicles are intensified with more frequent and aggressive lane changes, simulating a realistic and dynamic highway environment. This setup challenges the autonomous vehicles to adapt quickly to changing conditions and maintain safety.
