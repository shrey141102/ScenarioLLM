# Conclusion and Future Work

## Conclusion

This research extended the LLMScenario framework with modern LLMs, enhanced visualization, and agent-based approaches. Our findings demonstrate that:

1. **State-of-the-art LLMs significantly improve scenario generation** compared to earlier models, with particular improvements in trajectory realism and interaction complexity.

2. **Visualization is essential for understanding and validating generated scenarios**, providing insights that text descriptions alone cannot convey.

3. **Agent-based enhancement shows conceptual promise but faces implementation challenges** that must be addressed before practical deployment.

4. **Different LLMs exhibit distinct strengths** in scenario generation, suggesting that an ensemble approach might yield optimal results.

Our work confirms the viability of LLM-based scenario generation for autonomous driving research while providing clear pathways for improvement.

## Future Work

Several promising directions for future research emerge from our findings:

1. **Hybrid LLM approach**: Combining the strengths of multiple models in an ensemble framework to leverage each model's unique capabilities.

2. **Structured agent outputs**: Developing more constrained prompt engineering techniques to guide agents toward producing valid trajectory data.

3. **Real-time interactive scenario generation**: Creating a system where scenarios evolve dynamically based on user input or agent decisions.

4. **Cross-dataset validation**: Testing the framework on diverse driving datasets beyond HighD to ensure generalizability.

5. **Integration with simulation environments**: Connecting the generated scenarios directly to industry-standard simulation tools like CARLA or SUMO.

6. **Human evaluation studies**: Conducting formal assessments with domain experts to validate the realism and utility of generated scenarios.

These improvements would further enhance the practical utility of LLM-driven scenario generation for autonomous vehicle development and testing.
