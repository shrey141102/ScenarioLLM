# Comparison with LLMScenario Paper Metrics

## Original LLMScenario Metrics

The original LLMScenario paper used two primary metrics:

1. **Reality Score**: Evaluates if scenarios are realistic, checking for:
   - Vehicle collisions
   - Disobedience of traffic rules
   - Violation of vehicle dynamics constraints
   - Vehicles out of drivable area

2. **Rarity Score**: Measures how different generated scenarios are from:
   - Original prompt scenario
   - Normal safe scenarios
   - Previously generated scenarios

## Our Comparable Metrics

We've implemented similar metrics:

1. **Reality Score**: Evaluates physical realism by checking:
   - Realistic acceleration/deceleration
   - Absence of vehicle collisions
   - Proper trajectory continuity

2. **Rarity Score**: Evaluates complexity and uniqueness through:
   - Number of interactions
   - Lane change frequency
   - Overall scenario complexity

## Results Comparison

| Model | Reality Score | Rarity Score | Combined Score | Collisions |
|-------|--------------|--------------|----------------|------------|
| gpt4 | 0.82 | 0.48 | 1.30 | 0 |
| claude | 0.45 | 0.73 | 1.18 | 1 |
| gemini | 1.00 | 0.84 | 1.84 | 0 |

## Key Differences

Our metrics differ from the original paper in the following ways:

1. **Reality checking approach**: While the original paper uses a more comprehensive approach
   with traffic rule checking, our implementation focuses on physical dynamics and collisions.

2. **Rarity calculation**: The original paper uses a distance metric between scenario graphs,
   while our approach uses complexity as a proxy for rarity.

3. **Score combination**: The original uses a weighted linear combination of scores with thresholds,
   while our approach adds reality and rarity scores directly (when reality > 0).

## Conclusion

Our evaluation system captures the same core principles as the LLMScenario paper:
balancing realism with challenge/rarity. Given the implementation differences,
the absolute values are not directly comparable, but the relative rankings
between models should provide similar insights.
